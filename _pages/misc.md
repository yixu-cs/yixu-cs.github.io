Nature has a special attraction for me—I enjoy [birdwatching](https://yixu-cs.github.io/misc/birdwatching/), hiking, and I have a deep love for our planet. 

I am also passionate about literature. I love Dostoevsky, Maugham, Tagore, Gibran, Hai Sang, and Xi Murong. I write [poems](https://yixu-cs.github.io/misc/poems/) by myself.
I’m very interested in psychology; I learned Harvard’s Positive Psychology, and read some related books, and I enjoy meditation and yoga.

Additionally, I love swimming and play football as a goalkeeper.
