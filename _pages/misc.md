Nature has a special attraction for me—I enjoy [birdwatching](/misc/birdwatching/), hiking, and I have a deep love for our planet. 

I am also passionate about literature, and I write [poems](/misc/poems/) by myself. I love Dostoevsky, Maugham, Tagore, Gibran, Hai Sang, and Xi Murong. 
I’m very interested in psychology; I learned Harvard’s Positive Psychology, and read some related books, and I enjoy meditation and yoga.

Additionally, I love swimming and play football as a goalkeeper.
