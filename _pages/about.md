I am a second-year Master’s student at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Pan Peng](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ppeng/). I received my bachelor’s degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology at the same university. I am also very grateful for the guidance of Prof. [Christian Sohler](https://cds.uni-koeln.de/en/people/core-scientists/prof-dr-christian-sohler) and Prof. [Lili Qiu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lili/).

My research interests include parameter approximation on graphs, spectral graph theory, sublinear algorithms, streaming algorithms, and learning theory.

You can find my CV [here](/files/CV-USTC-Yi%20Xu.pdf) (last updated: Oct 2025).

On a more personal note, I enjoy [birdwatching](/misc/birdwatching/) and writing [poems](/misc/poems/).
