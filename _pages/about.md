I am currently a second-year Master’s student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by Prof. Pan Peng. I received my bachelor’s degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology at the same university.

My research interests include parameter approximation on graphs, spectral graph theory, sublinear algorithms, streaming algorithms, and learning theory.

On a more personal note, I enjoy [birdwatching](/misc/birdwatching/) and writing [poems](/misc/poems/).
