This course mainly introduces the basics of Randomized Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms, and Distributed Algorithms, and the methods to analyze the efficiency and correctness of algorithms.

Description
------
This course is designed for international students in USTC, and the language is English.

My Role
------
Design and grade assignments, lead exercise classes to explain solutions, hold office hours for student support and mentoring, and assist with exam grading.
When I communicate with international students, I speak in English.

Syllabus
------
