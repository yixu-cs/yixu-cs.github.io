ISC used to be an offline competition, but due to COVID19, ISC 2021 was held remotely, and 13 teams need to complete a series of tasks on two shared computing clusters. 

In competing, we are asked to run the following challenges: micro-benchmarks, including the HPL (Linpack) benchmark, the HPC Challenge (HPCC) benchmark and the High-Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) benchmark; challenging HPC applications, including the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, the GPAW atomic-scale quantum mechanical simulation model, the MetaHipMer2 model (which is a de novo metagenome short-read assembler) and the LAMMPS classical molecular dynamics code (which focuses on materials modeling); and, finally, a coding challenge, which this year focused on the MPI_alltoallv profiler, requiring teams to perform deep analysis on GPAW and WRF inputs, add heatmap support to the GUI and more.


Background
------

[WRF](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf) is a numerical weather prediction model, and is currently in operational use at National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and other national meteorological centers as well as in real-time forecasting configurations at laboratories, universities, and companies.

dA: change in a forecast variable at a particular point in space
F(A): the dynamical and physical processes that can change the value of A
dt: change in time(time step)
